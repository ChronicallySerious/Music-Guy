# Music Guy

Music Guy is a action/rhythm game based on mimicing the beat makeup of a song which in turn help the Music Guy cross a series of cleverly placed obstacles either by jumping over them or by using special abilities.

## Status of submission

This game was not able to be completed in the time duration for [Jim Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/jimjam-2) due to some personal engagement I had to attend to at in that time period.

However I will be pushing this game to completion because I like its idea a lot.
